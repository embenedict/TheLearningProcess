		This is a letter of sorts that I will write to my friends as I learn to code. Welcome to the trip.It's a motivation tactic of sorts. Dan Ariely calls it reward substitution. You can learn more about that in the first 10 min of <a href="http://youtu.be/V1AsL8_cifk">this video.</a> Essentially, all it means is that I'm taking something that is long-term important/meaningful to me but somewhat difficult (learning to code) and giving myself a short-term reward (talking to my friends).

		The first person to see this will probably be my good friend Betsy. What do you think, Bets? If you or anyone else is interested in writing back </p>
